# Happy New Year Script
Sends out texts to people wishing them a happy new year, when the new year ocurrs. 

- created project 31/2019: was created because I was going to bed, but still wanted to wish my friends a happy new year at 00:00 / midnight.
- program was whipped up in about 15 minutes - there are many edits that can be done


NOTE:
- for this script to work, you will need to set up your Gmail account to accept SMTP connection from an outside source. 
- "email@gmail.com" -> this would be the senders email address
- "examplePassword" -> this would be the senders email password
- "xxx-xxx-xxxx@vtext.com" -> this would be the recipient's phone number
  - @vtext if for verizon -> this would need to be changed based on teh recipient's service provider
